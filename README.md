Domus is a full property operations workspace built directly into Nextcloud. Manage portfolios, units, and tenancies alongside tasks, documents, bookings, and distributions in one secure place so property teams stay aligned without leaving their cloud.

## Highlights
- Organize properties, units, and partners with structured records that stay linked.
- Track tenancies, bookings, and allocations while keeping financial context close by.
